			<h3>Training and Testing</h3>
			<p>Training and testing environments can be expensive to design and setup, not to mention the time it can take to do the training. Today conventional testing and training take a lot of people, it is not just the person who needs to learn the skills. VR technology can helpt to reduce these costs because while the initial setup might take longer, it is much easier to work with after the initial setup. Fields that can benefit from such techniques are medical, military, automotive, space, and plane industries.<sup>1</sup></p>
			<p>The military and NASA are already using VR technology to train astronauts and soldiers.<sup>1</sup> Raytheon is helping to develop military training programs that use VR technology.<sup>2</sup> These programs help the soldier to train in a realistic setting as a team unit or as an individual.<sup>2</sup> This helps to prepare them for the rigors of real battle and for biannual certification tests.<sup>2</sup></p>
			<p>Training new employees can be easily replicated with VR programs. In this manner employees can essentially train themselves reducing the impact of training new employees on the company. This is also highly effective in industries which require a lot of complex hands on training such as the medical industry.<sup>1</sup></p>
			<p>Testing works along the same lines as training, where the VR environment can be used to test new machines or do dangerous experiments. Product design becomes more effective as the designs can be shared and tested early on in the process.<sup>3</sup> The automotive industry along with companies that design spaceships and planes have already begun using VR in product testing.<sup>3</sup> Life threatening experiments can also be tested in Immersive Virtual Experiment Environments which use augmented reality to help test experiments in real time.<sup>3</sup></p>
			
			<h3>Advertising and Selling Items</h3>
			<p>VR has one use which might seem a little strange at first thought, the use of advertising or selling merchandise. VR can create virtual worlds which are realistic in nature and so can replicate real world objects, environments, and situations. The same way you could use VR to walk through Paris or Rome you could use it to walk through a Walmart or Ikea. Imagine if instead of a website with very simple small images, e-commerce was walking through a virtual store as if you were at the real thing.</p>
			<p>The benefit of the virtual world store is that when looking at an item you can look up data about it at the same time. You may even be able to 'physically' interact with the item and actually try it out.<sup>3</sup> This can begin in AR by putting on glasses for walking through a real store as well.</p>
			<p>But the real fun and question comes in with the use of VR for advertising. Like mentioned with the store advertising could be designed so you can interact as you want with the objects.<sup>3</sup> The issue is that this is a coded world and the way an object works in the VR world may not work the same as the object in the real world. So it becomes hard to trust the VR advertising. Yet the prospects that VR advertising and shopping at interesting in the least and would revolutionize the e-commerce business.</p>
