			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>The world is changing, ever moving forward towards tomorrow. Progress and technology coming hand in hand in hopes of a better world. One of these technologies is the Virtual Reality. Education, entertainment, and the working world will be forever changed by VR. It will break down boundaries, expand the power of the virtual world, and tranform the power-geometry of our world once again.</p>
			<p>In the past video game companies like Sega and Nintendo have tried to create VR gaming systems. They failed in the past but today's systems have better graphics, more immersive controls, and greater support. But there is more to the entertainment of VR than video games. Museums and the travel industry have begun the work of creating VR experiences for people to enjoy. Even television shows have begun an attempt into the world of VR entertainment.</p>
			<p>The workplace for years has been reaching past physical bounds allowing employees to work from home or on business trips. VR brings a new concept to this line of working being the virtual workplace where you can be in a VR work office and talk face to face. Businesses have a large advantage over most consumers in terms of VR use today because they often are more likely to have the money to buy the systems. That being said the uses of VR in the workplace are larger from improving working conditions to changing the way employees are trained.</p>
			<p>But the real key area for VR technology is education. We are constantly trying to improve the way we teach so that the next generation can be more prepared than the last, and in today's ever technologically dependent world we have decided it is time to bring technology to the classroom. VR technology can expand the range of teaching through use o different techniques for different learning styles or just helping students to visual abstract concepts. Instead of worry about materials for science experiments or whether it is too dangerous, the experiments could be simulated in a VR world. AR technology could eliminate the need for large heavy textbooks and allow students additional information when working on assignments or supplemental information during lectures.</p>
			<p>In fact VR has so much potential we may come to see the day where there is an entire room of the house designed for the use of entertainment as a VR room like something out of <i>Star Trek</i>. Students and employees might even stay at home just hooking themselves into VR headsets or coffins in order to be transported to the virtual classroom or workplace. Our world may be on the cusps of changing forever, and though this is a good thing we must still be weary of the ill effects of technology. Sitting too close to the TV can ruin your eyes and being dependent upon technology is not the best thing in the world.</p>
			<p>We also have to think of how this will effect the world as a whole not on the small scale of people's lives and how they work and learn, but in the relationships that people have with others. This is the idea of power-geometry discussed by Doreen Massey in her article "A Global Sense of Place", looking at who moves and doesn't move as well as who has power in relationships.<sup>1</sup> Power-geometry uses the key idea that as technology improves it creates a space-time compression, meaning it is easier to move across the world or simply talk to people from around the world in less time, which can change the relationships between people.<sup>1</sup> 200 years ago it would have take you maybe six months to send a letter from New York to California, today it can be done in less than a week or you could just pick up the phone and call the person. This is the concept of space-time compression which drives humans ever closer.</p>
			<p>But at the same time it can drive us farther apart too.<sup>1</sup> This is because not everyone has access to the technology that allows this instant transport or commutation. "Air travel might enable business- men to buzz across the ocean, but the concurrent decline in shipping has only increased the isolation of many island communities".<sup>1</sup> People in third world countries like Nigeria may not even have access to the internet which allows for most of today's instant communication. Not only has technology changed how we communicated but the relationship that we can form through the communication, and because of accessibility it has left some people behind.</p>
			<p>The power-geometry of this situation is simple, not everyone will have access to VR technology from the beginning and it may stay that way for years to come. Those with VR technology will enter a new era of space-time compression allowing them the ability to form new kinds of relationships in which the power belongs to the. Those with VR technology will have all the power and those without it are left behind in the past. Even more some the real power lies with the companies that make the VR technology, they will end up controlling the world. Even if Google essentially hands out VR for free with its Google Cardboard, the power will still lie with VR companies as some people will be able to buy better gear putting them above everyone else. Mobility in the world may soon be defined by the VR technology you own.</p>
			<p>As the virtual world expands from something we peer into with computers to a place we can walk around in with VR, we must learn to balance it with the physical world. VR technology is by no means bad, no technology is, though it can be used in the wrong ways. We must learn how to bring it into our lives without destroying our lives. Will we let VR technology completely change the relationships of today's world? Will we allow ourselves to become absorbed by a virtual universe as if it were real? Will we grow to be antisocial beings? Will VR technology only bring about a dystopia like in the book <i>Ready Player One</i> by Ernest Cline, where business control the world? Or will we work to make the future a better place with the help of VR technology? VR is still in its early years, though the concept may have existed for decades, so we must guide it and let it grow into a tool that helps humanity and doesn't hinder it. It is up to us if we are heading towards a utopian society, where VR technology improves our lives, or a dystopian society, where we are consumed by the need to use and dependent upon the use of VR technology.</p>
