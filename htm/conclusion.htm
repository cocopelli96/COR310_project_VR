			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>The world is changing, ever moving forward towards tomorrow. Progress and technology coming hand in hand in hopes of a better world. One of these technologies is the Virtual Reality. Education, entertainment, and the working world will be forever changed by VR. It will break down boundaries and expand the power of the virtual world.</p>
			<p>In the past video game companies like Sega and Nintendo have tried to create VR gaming systems. They failed in the past but today's systems have better graphics, more immersive controls, and greater support. But there is more to the entertainment of VR than video games. Museums and the travel industry have begun the work of creating VR experiences for people to enjoy. Even television shows have begun an attempt into the world of VR entertainment.</p>
			<p>The workplace for years has been reaching past physical bounds allowing employees to work from home or on business trips. VR brings a new concept to this line of working being the virtual workplace where you can be in a VR work office and talk face to face. Businesses have a large advantage over most consumers in terms of VR use today because they often are more likely to have the money to buy the systems. That being said the uses of VR in the workplace are larger from improving working conditions to changing the way employees are trained.</p>
			<p>But the real key area for VR technology is education. We are constantly trying to improve the way we teach so that the next generation can be more prepared than the last, and in today's ever technologically dependent world we have decided it is time to bring technology to the classroom. VR technology can expand the range of teaching through use o different techniques for different learning styles or just helping students to visual abstract concepts. Instead of worry about materials for science experiments or whether it is too dangerous, the experiments could be simulated in a VR world. AR technology could eliminate the need for large heavy textbooks and allow students additional information when working on assignments or supplemental information during lectures.</p>
			<p>In fact VR has so much potential we may come to see the day where there is an entire room of the house designed for the use of entertainment as a VR room like something out of <i>Star Trek</i>. Students and employees might even stay at home just hooking themselves into VR headsets or coffins in order to be transported to the virtual classroom or workplace. Our world may be on the cusps of changing forever, and though this is a good thing we must still be weary of the ill effects of technology. Sitting too close to the TV can ruin your eyes and being dependent upon technology is not the best thing in the world.</p>
			<p>As the virtual world expands from something we peer into with computers to a place we can walk around in with VR, we must learn to balance it with the physical world. VR technology is by no means bad, no technology is, though it can be used in the wrong ways. We must learn how to bring it into our lives without destroying our lives. VR is still in its early years, though the concept may have existed for decades, so we must guide it and let it grow into a tool that helps humanity and doen't hinder it. It is up to us if we are heading towards a utopian society, where VR technology improves our lives, or a dystopian society, where we are consumed by the need to use and dependent upon the use of VR technology.</p>
