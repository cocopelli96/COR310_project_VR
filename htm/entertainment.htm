			<h1>The VR Revolution and Entertainment</h1>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>In the long forgotten past entertainment was but a past time to escape from the troubles of the real world. Today it is a multimillion dollar industry that produces more information than any other industry in the world. Years ago it was limited to gladiatorial battles and theatre performances, today we have movies, TV shows, and video games among other forms of entertainment.</p>
			<p>VR technology has the potential to change the way we entertain ourselves forever. The change could hit any area of entertain we can think of but let's focus on three: travel, museums and galleries, and video games. The travel industry has began work on expanding into VR technology, the idea being that you can now go anywhere in the world while never leaving your house. Museums and image galleries may also soon me making the shift toward VR tours and viewing. But it is not the first time VR has attempted to crawl into the gaming industry. Since the conception of the idea of VR in the early 1960s, there has been a long history of attempts to change the the gaming industry.<sup>2</sup> The goal of the movement to make gaming more realistic and immersive than ever before.</p>
			<p>Before we move on to those areas of entertainment let's discuss movies and TV and how they might be affected by VR technology. This after all is not an area that is easy to grasp at first that it could be effected.</p>
			
			<h3>Movies and TV</h3>
			<p>Now this seems like an odd idea because we consider movies and TV shows to be a straight forward path that we view. I sit down I turn on the show and I watch it. No matter how much I yell, "No don't go down stairs." The characters still go downstairs, watching TV is not interactive. In fact it never has been interactive and we don't actual expect it to be interactive. But there are two ways that VR technology can change movies and TV shows which are the way in which we view shows and interactivity of shows.</p>
			<p>Think of 3D and 4D movies, they are essentially the same movies as the 2D versions. However the way we view them makes us feel more like we are inside the movie than before. This same feeling applies to VR versions of movies which are sure to follow. The viewer will be completely inside of the world of the movie. And quite possibly you could be able to get new views of the same old movies by being able to look around the room to see the events unfold the you want to see them.</p>
			<p>But why stop there? VR technology can begin to blend the ideas of a movie and a video game. What if when you were watching a TV show and you got to interact with the world? Now maybe you can change things and maybe you can't, but you won't know until you try. In fact there is already a TV show which is attempting to do just this. Syfy is now airing an original multimedia part VR TV series called 'Halcyon'.<sup>1</sup></p>
			<p>'Halcyon' a "crime investigation series takes place in a future where VR has become part of our everyday lives."<sup>1</sup> The show is designed to be 15 episodes long, 10 of the episodes will be normal TV episodes and 5 will be interactive VR episodes.<sup>1</sup> This is a new step for entertainment which puts viewers directly inside of TV series. Now you can get the full story in the 10 regular episodes, but with the Oculus Rift or Samsung Gear VR you can experience the VR episodes for a new form of entertainment.<sup>1</sup> If you would like more information of this show then click the following link: <a href="http://halcyonvr.com" target="new"><i>Halcyon</i></a></p>

			</ul>
			
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>VR is a strange a fascinating concept and what has been discussed hear is only the beginning of its potential. If VR becomes main stream it will change the world forever and entertainment is likely to be the first thing that will change. Is this good? Well it offer more and new ways to experience the same old things and as of today cannot completely replace the real world. It is up you to decide if this means that the travel industry is about to crumble, if museums are going to close, or if video game companies are wasting their money. Most people however seem to think VR is going to rocket us into a new and better world.</p>
			<p>Either way the entertainment industry will not be destroyed by the introduction of VR technology. It may just take a shift from the real world to the virtual world. This is revolution that our generation will get to experience the same kind of revolution which occurred with introduction of the radio, the television, the internet, and the smart phone. Each time the entertainment industry was changed forever and today we would say it was for the best, before the revolution was over though there had to be a point when it was questioned just like VR technology is questioned today.</p>
