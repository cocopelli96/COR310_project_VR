			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>2016 has been called the year of virtual reality (VR). Three big virtual reality headsets will be released by the end of this year. It is the big push by video game companies to make VR gaming the next hot thing. But are the uses of VR technology limited to just video games? Turns out they're not, it's just the first thing we think of when we say virtual reality in today's world.</p>
			<p>The uses of VR technology are as limitless as the virtual environments they can bring you to. Today it might not be viable for VR technology to be seen in every aspect of our lives, but in the future we will see this technology becoming even cheaper and easier to use. The opportunities are endless.</p>
			<p>So what are some of the uses of VR technology?</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="font-bold">Video Games</span> - Honestly the biggest opportunity is the gaming industry. People have always felt like they could get immersed in games, but now it is actually possible.</li>
				<li><span class="font-bold">TV</span> - Why just watch TV when you can interact with it? VR TV shows and movies are a great idea. What if I got to decide the story I see or if I could change it by interacting with the world?</li>
				<li><span class="font-bold">Training</span> - There are some kinds training that need to be done over and over again to get it down. There are some kinds of training that are expensive to do or hard to setup, but VR technology can change this. Medical and military training are two examples of training that would be greatly effected by the use of VR technology.</li>
				<li><span class="font-bold">Teleconferences</span> - Time for a meeting at the office. So I put on my VR headset and viola I am standing in the virtual office and so is everyone else. Time to take teleconferences to the next level.</li>
				<li><span class="font-bold">Travel</span> - Want to go to Egypt, Rome, or France? Maybe you are trying to make the last decision on where to go, or you just want to get a peek of another location. Well this use of VR technology brings you to another location in around the world.</li>
				<li><span class="font-bold">Museums and Galleries</span> - Just like traveling we can use VR technology to tour museums or to view large collections of images.</li>
				<li><span class="font-bold">Advertising</span> - How would the advertising field change if you could pick up and play with the item being advertised to you?</li>
				<li><span class="font-bold">Education</span> - There are many uses VR technology when it comes to education. It could be used to compensate for different learning styles or to experience and learn about difficult ideas. Image learning about the civil war while watch the battle of Gettysburg or learning about atoms while actually being able to see electron fields.</li>
