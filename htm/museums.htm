			<h1>VR Museums and Galleries</h1>
			<h3>Museums</h3>
			<p>Museums have been an important part of society for some time now. They provide learning in a different way than classrooms and even have become more of an entertainment business than a learning one. That being said, how would VR change museums?</p>
			<p>One option is the augmented reality (AR) route, which the museums to add an extra layer of digital data on top of the museum. This would make it so when you walk around you can gain more information on the items through possible interact interfaces and menus. This could be something designed as a smart phone app or on a device like Google Glass.<sup>1</sup></p>
			<p>Another option is to create virtual museum tours which can be viewed anywhere by anyone. No longer is there the need for a physical museum and it add many options to the user. Exhibits could become more lifelike and interactive using VR technology. There could be text hovering in the air or audio that describes the exhibits.<sup>1</sup> The tour could also provide more in depth information on topics of exhibits than normal museums offer by allowing users to focus in on exhibits they want to know more about.<sup>1</sup></p>
			<p>The best part about VR museums is that you are not restricted by the reality of everyday life not the physical need of space. A VR museum could be as large as you want and in any shape, able to hold who knows how many exhibits. Exhibits could even move like a video reenacting part of the civil war. And the question will become, when we have VR museums what will happen to the artifacts that once found homes in physical museums?</p>
			
			<h3>Image Galleries</h3>
			<p>Today digital image galleries can be quite large and searching through them can be quite the chore. Even with digital search terms the groups of images can still be large and hard to navigate.<sup>2</sup> VR technology might offer a solution to working with large image galleries. A study done in 1999 by the Center for Mathematics and Computer Science looked at VR interfaces for large image galleries.<sup>2</sup></p>
			<p>The design for viewing the images was three image filmstrips stacked on top of each other.<sup>2</sup> The user interface was designed to be looking in different directions. So looking left would slide images to the left and looking right would slide them to the right.<sup>2</sup> This offers a new way to look at large image galleries. However the question is whether or not it is any more effective than what we already have.</p>
			<p>The study concludes that the design of the VR image gallery is good. The study states that the head motions are an intuitive control system and easy to use since it doesn't need to be extreme direction changes.<sup>2</sup> They decided that the filmstrip design was also easier to work with than that of a photo album design.<sup>2</sup></p>
