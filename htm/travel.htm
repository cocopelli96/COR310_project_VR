			<h1>VR Travel</h1>
			<p>The travel industry is one of the strangest industries there is. It is completely dependent upon the customer's desire to explore the world and go somewhere new. They are attracted to several different things from tourist attraction in cities, to monuments, to beautiful scenery. Now imagine traveling all over the world, but you never left your house.</p>
			<p>This is what VR tourism and travel offers to the world. Except what does that change? Think about how many places make money off of just the aspect of people going to new places. Hotels and amusement parks make most of their money off of tourist not the people who live around them. But if we no longer need to travel to explore new lands, those business will go out of business.</p>
			<p>Or that is one theory. Mashable's article 'How Virtual Tourism Will Help Enhance Real-world Travel', introduces another theory one that says VR tourism will help to improve the travel industry. Why is this? VR pales in comparison to the real thing, at least today that is.<sup>1</sup> The experience of VR travel today is not the same as travel. When on a mountain in the real world you can feel the wind on your skin, not in a VR world. Walking around and viewing the world doesn't quite feel the same as real-life. Going to VR Disney World would definitely not be the same as real-life Disney World. You don't get the feeling and even if you can partecipate in every activity it you can't partecipate in the same way you would in real-life.</p>
			<p>Another reason is memories, some people also have the desire to make memories that are real and have meaning behind them. 'You canâ€™t replicate that in VR, but you can give people a preview and understanding of what they would experience if they went to visit physically.'<sup>1</sup> This view of VR tourism shows how the industry might make more money. Companies like <a href="http://www.youvisit.com/" target="new">YouVisit</a> have already begun making VR tours which bring you to a new part of the world.</p>
			<p>YouVisit has even collected statistics which say "13% of people who take a VR tour of a destination have their interest piqued."<sup>1</sup> This is comparative to what television did to tourism, a boom in the market because now people have an idea of what they will experience.<sup>1</sup> The other benefit of a VR tour is that it can help people to plan their trips ahead of time. They can preview different locations and did where they might actually want to go when traveling.</p>
			<p>But what people might be missing is that we are still in the early stage of VR. VR headsets today are not completely realistic, but that technology will not stay the same. VR experiences will only get more immersive and realistic, to the point where it may no longer be that VR doesn't live up to real-life. At that point what will happen to the travel industry? What today might cause a tourism boom, may tomorrow be the end of tourism as we know it.</p>
