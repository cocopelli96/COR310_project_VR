			<h1>History of VR Gaming</h1>
			<p>The biggest potential of VR technology today is in the gaming market. To be able to produce games that actually draw the user into a whole new world has been something people have dreamed of for years. Video games are always heading towards better graphics, more intuitive controls, and game play mechanics which make you feel like you are inside the world of the game. Story telling also is tested over and over to ensure that the story makes sense for the user and doesn't break their immersion. VR is the next logical step to the evolution of video games, though ironically it has been tried before.</p>
			<p>2016 sees a large amount of intrest in the rising VR gaming market, however VR gaming has tried and failed to exist in the past.<sup>2</sup> The article 'A Brief History of Video Game Virtual Reality, and Why This Time Will Be Different' by Robert Workman, talks about three VR systems of note from the past developed by Sega, Nintendo, and Virtuality Group.<sup>2</sup></p>
			
			<h3>Sega's VR Attempts</h3>
			<p>Sega made two attempts into VR in the the late 80s and early 90s. The first was a set of 3D glasses, which at the time was the first potential VR headset because it created a more immersive 3D world.<sup>1</sup> These glasses were usable with the Sega Master System. According to Sega Retro the glasses had two lens which opened and closed rapidly to create a 3D effect.<sup>1</sup> Several games were released to go with the glasses like <i>Space Harrier 3D</i> however they didn't sell well and Sega soon discontinued the project.<sup>2</sup></p>
			<p>Sega made a second attempt in VR with an actual VR headset system. Sega Retro tells us however that this one was never released.<sup>3</sup> Sega's press releases stated that the system was discontinued because it was so realistic that user would want to walk around.<sup>3</sup> However due to processing power of the time and leaked reports about possible safety hazards of the system, that is not believed to be the real reason.<sup>3</sup> These were some of the first attempts by game developers to head into the endless bounds of VR, sadly they didn't quite make it into the market.</p>

				<h3>Nintendo's Virtual Boy</h3>
				<p>Nintendo threw its hat into the ring with the Virtual Boy. This was a simple red and black headset that went for about $180.<sup>2</sup> It displayed 3D games in red and black graphics, not the best.<sup>2</sup> The system was discontinued the year after it was released. Once more VR failed to hold onto the market and continued to just make users feel queasy.<sup>2</sup> The same issues occurred with this system as with Sega's attempts into VR, the computing power and graphics couldn't hold up to the concept of VR games. This is what led to the queasy feeling that a lot of player got, but the systems helped to introduce gaming concepts and idea that would return in the future. One such concept is the 3D of video games which came back in Nintendo's 3DS system.<sup>2</sup></p>

			<h3>Arcade VR Units</h3>
			<p>Virtuality Group was another company that tried to make a VR system in the 90s.<sup>2</sup> Their system however looked a bit different, it wasn't for a home console but instead was a full arcade video game. The large arcade game allowed the user to take a seat and put on the VR headset. Next you threw in your money and grabbed the controls. Interestingly enough they actual had several games that could be played from racing games to pac-man to flight simulators that even produced g-forces when playing it.<sup>2</sup></p>
			<p>They also teamed up with Philips Electronics to produce a home version of the arcade system in 1998.<sup>2</sup> It was a fairly priced system running at a cost of $299 and ended up selling 55,000 units.<sup>2</sup> But even this system didn't last for long and has faded from the memory of the gaming community. It is hard to understand what these arcade games were like when we just talk abou them, so the following is a video that will give a better idea of how they worked.</p>

			<h3>Will it be different this time?</h3>
			<p>If VR gaming has tried and failed before to grab the entertainment industry's attention, what makes developers think it will be any different today? Will it be different? This is a two part question essentially, because we are first asking why VR failed and asking what the new systems today are doing differently. To start off the old VR systems were primitive.<sup>2</sup> They are nothing like the systems we see today with higher graphics, better controls, and more processing power to handle the extra immersive display of the VR system. Secondly they didn't have the support that they needed as a gaming device not enough resources being allocated to the project by the companies and not enough people that were interested in trying it out.<sup>2</sup></p>
			<p>So what does VR today have that those systems didn't have. Well for starts there is much more marketing that can happen today. From TV commercials to little images on web pages the word will get around fast about what these systems can do. That is going to be the key to getting people to buy the VR gaming systems so they can stay alive.<sup>2</sup> Beyond that there are features in some of the device that are very different. The Oculus Rift is designed so that anyone with the right amount of effort could make their own VR game and is set in a way tat expands regular gameplay in an immersive 3D environment.<sup>2</sup> The HTC Vive gives the user the ability to walk around the room giving they more freedom, control, and realistic game play. Google Cardboard is cheap and easy for people to use, costing only $20 and being compatible with any smart phone.</p>
			<p>VR today has a lot to offer which it didn't in the 80s and 90s. So it is not the fact that VR failed before and so it will fail again. What we are seeing is a revolution, learning from the mistakes of the past and building on the advancements in technology we have made since then. Get ready because VR gaming is going to be the next bg thing in entertainment.</p>
