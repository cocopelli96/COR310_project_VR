			<h1>Types of Virtual Reality</h1>
			<p>In 1989 Jaron Zepel Lanier introduced the idea of term 'Virtual Reality' (VR) to the "Sensorama, one of the earliest prototypes of the modern virtual reality equipment".<sup>2</sup> It is a little known idea that VR is a much broader range of technology than headsets that are used to play video games. In fact VR technology is so large that it can be classified into three groups. I will refer to these three groups as augmented reality, headset virtual reality, and room virtual reality.</p>
			
			<h3>What is Virtual Reality?</h3>
			<p>VR is a simple concept. "Virtual reality is a computer-generated environment that lets you experience a different reality."<sup>3</sup> Today this can come in two styles: being able to interact with the environment and simply being an observer.</p>
			
			<h3>Augmented Reality</h3>
			<p>Augmented Reality (AR) started as a branch of VR, but in the current day it is edging towards becoming another separate branch of technology.<sup>2</sup> They way AR works is that instead of immersing the user in a brand new virtual environment, you just add a layer of virtual data on top of the real world.<sup>2</sup> This is an especially enticing concept for phones and mobile gaming devices.</p>
			<p>Some examples of augmented reality are Pokemon Go or camera applications which use a special card that causes a cartoon image to appear on your device. With Pokemon Go the AR functionality appears when you go to capture a pokemon and it appears in the real world. This pokemon is a layer of virtual data being placed on top of our world to create a new experience for the user.</p>
			
			<h3>HMD Virtual Reality</h3>
			<p>HMD stands for Head-mounted Display and uses a headset to create a VR experience.<sup>1</sup> HMD VR is the VR that we would normally expect to be talking about today. "A VR headset fits around your head and over your eyes, and visually separates you from whatever space you're physically occupying."<sup>2</sup> Then it provides images to your eyes immersing you and another world entirely. With the use of special controllers and sensors you can interact with this world. Some headsets are easy to setup and very portable, while others allow you to walk around the room while sensors pick up your movements. The range of capabilities of VR headsets today is the first thing to think about when deciding what system you to get, obviously the second thing to think about is the cost.</p>
			<p>HMD VR would also expand to science fiction concepts of VR where you enter the virtual world by getting into a "coffin". Two science fiction tales that use "coffin" technology for VR are the movie <i>The Matrix</i> and James Dashner's book <i>The Eye of Minds</i>. The idea of "coffin" is you have an enclosed space that uses wires that hook into your body and connect to your nervous system and brain. The first reason for this is to place a feeling and image inside you of a virtual world. The second reason is to prevent you from moving around in the "coffin" so you don't hurt yourself. But as of today we are still many years from "coffin" technology. This might be hard to conceptualize so here is a video featuring "coffin" technology from <i>The Matrix</i>:</p>

			<h3>CAVE Virtual Reality</h3>
			<p>CAVE stands for computer automatic virtual environment.<sup>1</sup> "With the CAVE, the individual is submerged in the virtual environment surrounding him or her and can move naturally in this space."<sup>1</sup> No headset, cords, or controls are used. Today CAVE VR is about as complex as four projects showing you a virtual world on the walls.<sup>1</sup> There is no true interaction, no true immersion; but it is still VR. In the future CAVE VR might be able to will be able to use sensor for user to interact in the virtual environment. Someday they may even be able to create objects in the room with which the user can interact.</p>
			<p>One science fiction example of CAVE VR technology would be in the TV series <i>Star Trek</i>. <i>Star Trek</i> has a room which is called the holodeck which can be used to recreate different environments. This includes creating "hard light" holograms with which the users can interact. You don't put on a headset when entering the holodeck, it is simply that the room changes. If you are having a hard time understanding just what this would look like, please watch the following video featuring a holodeck from <i>Star Trek</i>:</p>
